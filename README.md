Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains a machine learning project built to demonstrate data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It includes end-to-end workflows covering data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and implementation of classification/regression algorithms. Models are trained, validated, and tested using best practices, with performance metrics for comparison. The project uses Python with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for analysis and visualization. Code is modular, well-documented, and easy to extend. This repo serves as a reference for beginners and practitioners interested in understanding and applying machine learning techniques to real-world datasets.
